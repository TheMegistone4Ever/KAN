# KAN

Project modified from [KAN](https://github.com/JianpanHuang/KAN). This repository demonstrates the application of
efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in a regression (curve fitting) task. The original KAN can be
found [here](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan), while the original efficient KAN can be
found [here](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan).
